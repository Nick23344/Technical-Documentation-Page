This project is a technical documentation page that introduces basic programming concepts such as variables, conditionals, and loops. The layout includes a fixed sidebar navigation for quick access to different sections. Topics learned and applied were:
- HTML Document Structure: Practiced organizing content into sections with headers and paragraphs to create a structured documentation layout.
- CSS Styling for Layout and Accessibility: Learned to use CSS for positioning, including fixed navigation and padding, to create a consistent layout.
- Responsive Design: Applied media queries to make the layout adaptable for different screen sizes, ensuring usability on mobile devices.
- Sidebar Navigation: Implemented a fixed sidebar with anchor links for quick navigation to each section, improving user experience.
- Syntax Highlighting and Code Blocks: Created visually distinct code sections within the documentation using custom styling.
